# Activito

Android sport tracker application.

## Description

The project was created as a first attempt at building a custom fitness tracker. The main motivation was to try out **Kotlin**. The application used the **Google Fit API**, but was eventually replaced by the [beFit](https://github.com/simecek-m/beFit) app, which also leveraged the new Health Connect SDK platform and Jetpack Compose.
